# Data Provenance Log/Read
Each entry below documents a data-collection event.
Auto-generated by the notebook.

To properly use dataset, implement this line of code:
dataset = pd.read_csv('/content/dataset.csv')
dataset.head() #shows that the file was properly read

If there is an error with the read, the datafile may be in a folder that was not intended for it.
Common fixes include 'dataset.csv' or '/content/(Working folder in Colab)/dataset.csv'

Example entry format:
- {"timestamp_utc": "...", "URL": "...", "data_type": {...},}
