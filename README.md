# Reproducibility for DeePeR

This repository demonstrates an ethical, reproducible data-collection workflow used in the CSC786 course.

## Overview
This project collects sample open data from dataset.csv found on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/krishuppal/dark-patterns?resource=download,
logs all collection metadata, and stores them in a version-controlled repository.
